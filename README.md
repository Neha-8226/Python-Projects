_**Steps Involved**_

_Data Exploration:_
Initial exploration to understand the data distribution and identify any missing values.

_Data Cleaning:_
Handled missing values and transformed categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

_Feature Engineering:_
Selected the most relevant features based on their importance scores.

_Modeling:_
Trained several models, including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, to predict customer churn.
Used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

_Model Evaluation:_
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

_Model Deployment:_
Deployed the model using Flask, allowing for real-time churn prediction.

_**Usage**_

_To run the project locally:_
_Clone the repository:_
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/telco-customer-churn-prediction.git
cd telco-customer-churn-prediction

_Install the required dependencies:_
pip install -r requirements.txt

_Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the analysis:_
jupyter notebook notebooks/Telco_Customer_Churn_Analysis.ipynb

_To deploy the model using Flask, run the following command:_
python scripts/model_deployment.py

**_Results_**
The final model achieved a high accuracy and ROC-AUC score, making it effective for predicting customer churn in a telecom context. The model can be used by companies to identify customers at risk of churning and take proactive measures to retain them.

_**Conclusion**_
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building and deploying a machine learning model for churn prediction. It highlights the importance of data cleaning, feature engineering, and model evaluation in achieving high predictive accuracy.
